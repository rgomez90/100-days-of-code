The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [01.07.2018].

## Log

### R1D1 

####React

Start learning ReactJS. Build first test site based on [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

React appears to very very easy if you know JS. It should be really handy when working with complex UI, like Dashboards or admin Panels, since you can create components, which you can handle separately and are kind of "isolated" from each other. Along with other stacks could be really easy to build interactive & dinamic UIs for the web. 

### R1D2

#### Static File Generators

Learned about Hugo and Jekyll and created first Test sites along examples

* Jekyll
* Hugo

Hugo appears to be more easy to start with, since you only need Hugo in your machine. If you already have a Ruby dev env or are a Ruby dev, maybe Jekyll is more for you. Both are not really different in what they do. Jekyll ships with a theme, but Hugo does not.

### R1D3

#### Flat File CMS

Learned about **Grav**, **Bolt** and **Pico**.

Buil first Test Grav on Azure.

**Grav** appears to be the most mature and the way to go for complex, stable scenarios.

### R1D4

### ASP.NET MVC

Continue learning about ASP.NET MVC. Done tutorial at [see](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started).
