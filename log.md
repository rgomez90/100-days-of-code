# RG's 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 1 
## .Net: WinForms, Asp.Net, EF - Web: CSS,HTML,JS,NodeJS,Express

### Day 1: January 01, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned to use AutoMapper in .NET and implemented it in MultiMess Project and continue implementing by learning Entity Framework Code First.

**Thoughts** AutoMapper seems to be really useful for mapping between types, more if the map don't require any dependencies are property names are same in source and target. I'm also finally understanding the differences between Model First and Code First in EF and starting to understand how to apply DDD principles in my app using EF.

### Day 2: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue working with EF Code First. Learned to implement TPC and TPT in EF. I implemented it in my measurements app. Thinking about how best way to design app's DB. Done some test mapping enums to tables and mapping complex types to Json and store in DB.

**Thoughts** Start to understand why and when should have a separate domain and data model. More flexibility but more code and mantainance. Understanding that in Programming I need to be pragmatic, there a very few "fixed" laws to follow and often the answer it "it depends---so be pragmatic---and always have YAGNI present

### Day 5: January 5, Wednesday

**Progress:** Working on seeing the difference between having a persistance model and a domain model, or using only domain model.

**Thoughts** Having  separated persistance objects obligates to mantain more code (mapping and objects). 
I will try to indentify when is better to have 2 models instead of one.

### Day 6: January 6, Wednesday

**Progress:** Trying to work with PLS. Start a project: "Make Website for Gaming League (2k). I've found a script (PLS) which can be good.
			Today I tried to understand PLS, see if fits for me. If not will try to make my own. Not sure which stack to use.

### Day 7: January 7, Wednesday

**Progress:** Worked on the new league website a bit. Continued PanojaFilms project implementing carousel for movies. Still learning CSS and bootstrap.
Also trying to find other frameworks. At night, some exercises from C# Step by Step. Also have in mind another project to learn ASP.NET -> A league/tournament manager.

**Thoughts** Having fun with CSS and bootstrap, but there are too many frameworks and libs. Bit difficult to get some overview. I think what's important is to understand
the basics. After it you can choose between this world of libs, looking which fits better, since you understand your needs better.

### Day 8: January 8, Monday

**Progress:**  Worked on Movie Website project. Continue learning CSS. Specially modals, popovers and tooltips. Implemented some basic JS.

**Thoughts** Getting quicker at coding, since I'm understanding how css and html work. Now, will improve my knowledge in DOM, JQuery and JavaScript.

### Day 9: January 9, Tuesday

**Progress:**  Mainly worked at movie project. Continued working on modals and popovers. Implemented some animations and tried to make an overview about animations libraries.

**Thoughts** It looks like I can animate things using only CSS. I also could use JS. There are tons of libs available

### Day 10: January 10, Wednesday

**Progress:**  Continue working at friend's movie portfolio project. Customized the popovers with movie description and added some animations (Animate.css).
