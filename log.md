# RG's 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 1 
## .Net: WinForms, Asp.Net, EF - Web: CSS,HTML,JS,NodeJS,Express

### Day 1: January 01, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned to use AutoMapper in .NET and implemented it in MultiMess Project and continue implementing by learning Entity Framework Code First.

**Thoughts** AutoMapper seems to be really useful for mapping between types, more if the map don't require any dependencies are property names are same in source and target. I'm also finally understanding the differences between Model First and Code First in EF and starting to understand how to apply DDD principles in my app using EF.

### Day 2: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue working with EF Code First. Learned to implement TPC and TPT in EF. I implemented it in my measurements app. Thinking about how best way to design app's DB. Done some test mapping enums to tables and mapping complex types to Json and store in DB.

**Thoughts** Start to understand why and when should have a separate domain and data model. More flexibility but more code and mantainance. Understanding that in Programming I need to be pragmatic, there a very few "fixed" laws to follow and often the answer it "it depends---so be pragmatic---and always have YAGNI present
